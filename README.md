# Smart_Dustbin
Automatic lid opener using a sensor and an actuator.
An ultrasonic distance sensor is used as a sensor and a servo motor is used as an actuator.
When the trash is brought near the bin, the sensor detects it. Since it is in the vicinity, trigger signal is sent to the servo.
The servo which is connected to the lid, opens. After a few seconds of delay, the lid closes.
